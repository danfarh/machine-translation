# Machine Translation with Attention and Transformers
This project aims to translate text from Persian to English and English to Persian using attention and transformers. The goal is to build a model that can accurately translate text between these two languages while retaining the context and meaning of the original text.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Persian-English Parallel Corpus, which is a collection of Persian and English sentences aligned at the sentence level.

## Approach
The project will use a machine learning approach to translate text between Persian and English. The following steps will be taken:

- Data Preparation: The dataset will be preprocessed and cleaned to remove any noise and irrelevant information.
- Feature Extraction: The text data will be transformed into a numerical representation using word embeddings.
- Model Development: A transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model with attention will be developed and trained on the features extracted from the text data.
- Model Evaluation: The model will be evaluated on a test set to measure its accuracy and other performance metrics.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- Keras
